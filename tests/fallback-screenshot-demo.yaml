name: Fallback Screenshot Demo
description: Test with NO explicit captures to demonstrate fallback logic
url: https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/

# All fillData steps have capture: false or not specified
fillData:
  - selector: '.new-todo'
    value: 'Task without screenshots'

submit:
  - type: click
    selector: '.new-todo'
  
  - type: waitForNavigation
    timeout: 2000

assertions:
  - type: exists
    selector: '.todoapp'

# Expected behavior:
# - Fallback screenshot captured BEFORE submit
# - Fallback screenshot captured AFTER submit
# Because no step has capture: true
