name: Explicit Screenshot Demo
description: Test with explicit capture configured to suppress fallback logic
url: https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/

# At least one step has capture: true
fillData:
  - selector: '.new-todo'
    value: 'Task 1'
    capture: true  # Explicit capture HERE
  
  - selector: '.new-todo'
    value: 'Task 2'
    # No capture for this step

submit:
  - type: click
    selector: '.new-todo'

assertions:
  - type: exists
    selector: '.todoapp'

# Expected behavior:
# - Screenshot captured only after "Task 1" fill step
# - NO fallback screenshots around submit
# Because at least one step has capture: true
